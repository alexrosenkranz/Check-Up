# Check Up!

> A patient centered electronic healthcare record (EHR) app build on a MERN stack

## Opportunity
Many people (especially young people) allow months, if not years, to go by between routine doctor appointments and check ups. This is typically caused by fear of what they'll find out, the busy day-to-day grind that occupies us, or the simple mindset of "I don't need to go because I feel fine". 

Check Up! is an application with the intent of building better patient habits. It will provide users with the ability to keep track of their appointment and health history in hopes to make them more mindful of their personal health.

## Key Features
- Keep track of your health care providers (Doctors, Labs, etc)
- Be reminded to create an appointment with your doctor
- The app will follow up with you after your appointment to enter some notes or medication you have been prescribed
- Enter and retreive any information about any past appointments or medical issues you may have had (i.e. medication taken for a certain illness, allergic reactions, etc.)

## Competition
Most applications that have similar functionality are more doctor/clinic facing so they can track information and not geared towards the patient/user creating better habits. Most popular user facing applications tend to be fitness based and not as much overall health based, examples of these would be Google Fit, Apple HealthKit, and Fitbit.

These companies excel at tracking personal fitness goals and general health but lack in the department of professional medical integration such as prescribed medication and notes pertaining to appointments. **Check Up!** aims to eventually bridge that gap, helping fitness-oriented users build better medical habits and vice versa.

## Database Architecture
This is built with a MySQL database architecture. We chose this so over time we have the ability to easily query data (i.e. popular medications, how many patients does a doctor see, etc) and trends in the future. Over time there may the need to add some more columns into our databases depending on what type of features are brought on.

## User Acquisition
We want to start off acquiring people from different backgrounds (specifically age and technological intuition) and test what features work better than others. These users will most likely come from word-of-mouth promotion so we can control our initial audience and gauge any feedback efficiently.

Social networking, an intuitive website, and content marketing campaigns with health and lifestyle publications will be our main focus when it comes to onboarding our next 1000 users. Since there doesn't seem to be much direct competition in the market, rushing to a wide release wouldn't be in our best interest. It would be a better route to make sure all of our key features are working as intended and efficiently before a full push into the market.
